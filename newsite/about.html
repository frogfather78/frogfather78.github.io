<p>Hand-coded again, literally typing this into an IDE.</p>
<p>Massive thanks to <a href="https://nolnir.newgrounds.com/news/post/1545231" target="_blank">Nolnir's f*ck it, let's make a website post</a> for the pointers for how to do this in 2025.</p>
<p>And, you can tell, there's no template behind this. Just a handful of &lt;p&gt;s and CSS classes.</p>
<p>I had a few other websites, previously. I posted a fair bit on Twitter, back in the day. All of which is now in the wind. Maybe some of them are indexed somewhere. Currently my Wordpress and Bluesky stuff is up and I understand that I should be able to retrieve stuff from them if I ever need to, but they are on someone else's website.</p>
<p>And yeah, this is on github, but it's also on my hard drive(s), so it can go somewhere else if the time ever comes.</p>
