    <p><i>The</i> online home of frogfather.</p>
    <p>I'm re-embracing the homespun static website life. My first site was written in self-taught HTML on the old
        warwick.ac.uk domain and I spent days adding things and forgetting to chmod them to +755(?) so they didn't
        actually appear where I put them until I could get back to the computer lab. Happier days.</p>
    <p>Now everyone* spends their time refreshing a feed on one of three websites and the world is immeasurably worse
        for the lack of some idiot putting up a mouse-drawn .jpg of something called "Chipolata Monkeys" to amuse the
        four friends who ever logged into the site.</p>
    <p class="footnote">*some people apparently don't spend their entire waking life on their phones and I am jealous
        and want to get back to it</p>
    <p>I might add more pages over time, but the main thing is: this is here.</p>
